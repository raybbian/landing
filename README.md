# Landing Queues

This is your stereotypical todo list app. It's a simple app that allows you to add, remove, and complete tasks in
queue-like data structures. It was made in order to motivate myself to do daily Codeforces problems (which are added automatically if you name a queue "Codeforces"), but it can be used for just about anything.

## Features
- Add, remove, and complete tasks
- Authentication (Github OAuth)
- ORM and Data Validation (via Prisma)
- Relational Database (PostgreSQL)
